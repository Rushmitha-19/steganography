# steganography
This project focuses on developing a secure and efficient steganography system that allows users to hide sensitive data within digital images. By utilizing advanced techniques in data embedding and extraction, the system aims to provide a reliable method for confidential communication while maintaining the visual integrity of the cover images.
The primary objectives of the project are as follows:

Data Embedding: To create a method for embedding text or binary data into a cover image using steganographic techniques, ensuring that the hidden data is imperceptible to the human eye.

Data Extraction: To develop a reliable mechanism for retrieving the hidden data from the stego image, accurately reconstructing the original information.

Security Enhancement: To implement encryption and other security measures that protect the hidden data from unauthorized access and detection.

User Experience: To design an intuitive user interface that simplifies the process of data hiding and extraction, providing real-time feedback and visual representation of the changes made to the image.

Performance Evaluation: To assess the system's performance based on key metrics such as capacity, imperceptibility, and robustness against common image processing operations.
